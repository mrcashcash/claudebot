# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Telegram (and optionally Slack) → Claude Code gateway. The Node.js process runs a Telegraf bot, and — when Slack env vars are set — also a Slack Bolt app in Socket Mode. Both transports feed each incoming message to `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `query()` through a shared core (`buildBot`'s `kickOffTurn`), then stream Claude's response back to the chat. Tool calls Claude wants to make are routed through inline buttons (Telegram inline keyboard / Slack Block Kit actions — same `Allow / Always / Deny / Never` set) before they execute. There is no web UI; the bots themselves are the only interfaces.

**Single process, dual transport.** Slack is opt-in via `.env` (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` + `ALLOWED_SLACK_USER_IDS`). When all three are set, the same Node process runs both transports, sharing `data/config.json`, sessions, scheduler, approvals, and per-user/per-chat state. With any missing, Slack stays off and the bot is Telegram-only — no regression. Slack channel/user ids ("C…", "U…") and Telegram numeric ids share the same string keyspace inside `data/config.json` and the in-memory turn queue without colliding.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # tsx watch — auto-reloads on src/ changes (preferred for development)
npm start          # one-shot run via tsx
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit; the only "build" check (project is noEmit)
```

There are no tests, no linter, and no build artifacts. `tsx` runs `.ts` directly; `tsconfig.json` has `noEmit: true` and `allowImportingTsExtensions: true`, so all relative imports use the explicit `.ts` extension (`./app.ts`, not `./app`). Keep that convention when adding files.

Required env (see `.env.example`): `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS` (comma-separated numeric Telegram user IDs — anything else is silently dropped by the auth middleware in `src/telegram/app.ts`). Optional: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (otherwise the SDK reuses `~/.claude/.credentials.json`). Optional Slack: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` + `ALLOWED_SLACK_USER_IDS` — all three together enable Slack; any missing keeps Slack off.

Per-user app behavior (workspace, permission mode, model, voice, tz) lives in `data/users/<telegram-user-id>.json` — auto-created from `userTemplate.json` on each authorized user's first message and reloaded on the next turn whenever the file changes (fs.watch with ~200ms debounce). Workspace / permissionMode / model can additionally be overridden **per chat** via the chat-layer in `data/sessions.json` so each Telegram group remembers its own settings independently of the user's other chats; the `/workspace` `/mode` `/model` `/cloudexpert` slash commands write to the chat layer in groups and the user layer in DMs. Deleting a user's JSON file does NOT revoke their access — auth is gated by `ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS`. The bot never edits `.env`.

## Architecture

Module map (everything lives in `src/`). The codebase splits cleanly into **core** (transport-agnostic), **telegram/** (Telegraf-coupled), and **slack/** (Slack Bolt-coupled). Anything in `core/` or `handlers/` should never `import` from `telegram/` or `slack/`.

**Top level**

- `index.ts` — entrypoint and lifecycle orchestrator. Loads config, hydrates state, builds the turn engine + Telegram app + (optional) Slack app, registers transports with the scheduler, consumes the restart marker (posting "✅ reloaded" to each chat via the matching transport), starts everything, and on SIGINT/SIGTERM runs the dual-transport graceful shutdown.
- `config.ts` — env parsing. `loadConfig()` returns `{ telegramBotToken, allowedUserIds, gatewayDir, slack? }`. The optional `slack` block is populated only when all three Slack env vars are set.
- `configValidate.ts` — pure validators (`parsePermissionMode`, `parseWhisperModel`, …) plus `validateUserConfig`, shared between `config.ts` and `state/users.ts`.

**`core/` — the shared turn engine**

- `core/turnEngine.ts` — `buildTurnEngine(config)` returns a `TurnEngine` with `kickOffTurn(io, chatId, userId, prompt, opts?)`, `abortTurn`, queue/in-flight introspection, and shutdown helpers. Owns the per-chat FIFO tail Promise queue, in-flight tracking, and the `runTurn` SDK loop. **This is the file you'll touch for behavior changes that apply to both transports.** No Telegraf or Slack imports.

**`handlers/` — transport-agnostic shared code**

- `handlers/turnIO.ts` — the `TurnIO` interface only (`chatId`, `chatKind`, `transport`, `reply`, `editMessage`, `removeButtons`, `sendChatAction`, optional `sendVoice`/`sendAudio`). Each transport's adapter lives in its own folder.
- `handlers/approvals.ts` — in-memory map of `tool_use_id → resolver` for pending Allow/Deny prompts.
- `handlers/questions.ts` — handles the SDK's `AskUserQuestion` tool. Renders one question at a time using `TurnIO.reply` / `editMessage` with a `ButtonGrid`; supports single- and multi-select; resolves with `{ [question]: answerLabel }`.
- `handlers/streamingReply.ts` — live-edits a single message as Claude streams text. Pure `TurnIO` calls — no transport awareness.
- `handlers/toolApprovals.ts` — `buildCanUseTool` (the `CanUseTool` SDK callback) and `applyPermissionCallback` (settles a `perm:*` callback id and returns the verdict + UI strings). Each transport's `actions.ts` calls into `clickRouter.ts` rather than this directly.
- `handlers/clickRouter.ts` — transport-agnostic dispatch for `q:*` (AskUserQuestion) and `perm:*` (tool approval) clicks. Both transports' `actions.ts` build a small `ClickContext` from their callback payload and call `dispatchQuestionClick` / `dispatchApprovalClick`; this module owns the audit log + post-click message edit.
- `handlers/commandShared.ts` — `MODE_ALIASES`, `MODEL_ALIASES`, `COMMAND_MENU`, `writeOverride`, `scopeNote`, `ChatKind` — small building blocks shared by the runner.
- `handlers/commandRunner.ts` — single source of truth for slash-command behavior. `runCommand(deps, name, args)` handles every command (`/help`, `/status`, `/mode`, `/model`, `/workspace`, `/cloudexpert`, `/init`, `/compact`, `/resume`, `/new`, `/cancel`, `/cost`, `/rules`, `/respond`, `/voice`, `/cron`) using `TurnIO`. Each transport's `commands.ts` is a thin adapter that builds `CommandDeps` and calls `runCommand`.
- `handlers/respondModes.ts` — `RespondMode` type + `VALID_RESPOND_MODES`. The actual respond-gate impl is per-transport because it inspects transport-native message metadata.

**`telegram/` — Telegraf transport**

- `telegram/app.ts` — `buildTelegramApp(config, engine, bootTime)`. Creates the Telegraf bot, wires auth middleware, registers commands/actions/media handlers, and exposes `start` / `stop` / `kickOffTurnFromCron` / `notifyChat` / `setMyCommands`. Mirror of `slack/app.ts`.
- `telegram/io.ts` — `ioFromContext(ctx)` and `ioFromTelegram(client, chatId)` build a `TurnIO` over the Telegraf client. Stringifies the chat id at the boundary; reverses with `Number(chatId)` when calling `bot.telegram.*`.
- `telegram/actions.ts` — `registerTelegramActions(bot)` wires `bot.on(callbackQuery("data"))` to forward `q:*` and `perm:*` clicks to the shared `clickRouter`. Also exports `safeAnswerCbQuery` for swallowing "query is too old" errors.
- `telegram/commands.ts` — thin Telegraf adapter: iterates `COMMAND_MENU` and registers a `bot.command(name, …)` for each, building a `CommandDeps` from `ctx` and calling `runCommand` in `handlers/commandRunner.ts`. All command logic (including `/cron list|pause|resume|delete`) lives in the runner — this file just bridges Telegraf↔runner.
- `telegram/mediaHandlers.ts` — `bot.on(message("photo" | "document" | "voice" | "audio"))`. Album debounce, image base64 attachment, file save to `<workspace>/.uploads/`, voice transcription via `services/voice/`.
- `telegram/respondGate.ts` — `shouldRespond(ctx)`: DM always responds; group consults `sessions.<chatId>.respondTo` and Telegram message entities for the @-mention check.
- `telegram/replyContext.ts` — `buildReplyContext(reply)` formats a short quote prefix when the user is replying to another message.

**`slack/` — Slack Bolt transport**

- `slack/app.ts` — `buildSlackApp(slack, config, engine, bootTime)`. Creates the Bolt app in Socket Mode, registers events + actions, exposes `start` / `stop` / `notifyChat`. Registers itself as the "slack" cron transport.
- `slack/io.ts` — `ioFromSlack(client, channelId, chatKind, threadTs?)` builds a `TurnIO` using `chat.postMessage` / `chat.update` and Block Kit `actions` blocks for `ButtonGrid`. When `threadTs` is set, all replies go into that thread.
- `slack/handlers.ts` — `registerSlackEvents(app, deps)` wires `message.im` (DMs) and `app_mention` (channels). Strips the `<@bot>` prefix from mentions, anchors the reply thread to `event.thread_ts ?? event.ts` so back-and-forth stays in-thread, dispatches `/cmd` to `slack/commands.ts`, otherwise calls `engine.kickOffTurn`.
- `slack/actions.ts` — `app.action(/^(?:perm|q):/)` block_actions handler that forwards to the shared `clickRouter` — mirror of `telegram/actions.ts`.
- `slack/commands.ts` — `dispatchSlackCommand` is a thin adapter that parses `/cmd args` and calls `handlers/commandRunner.ts → runCommand`. All command logic is shared with Telegram.
- `slack/format.ts` — small Markdown → Slack `mrkdwn` converter (only the link form `[t](u)` → `<u|t>` differs).

**`services/`**

- `services/claude.ts` — wraps the Agent SDK. `askClaude()` calls `query()`, accumulates assistant text, captures `session_id` and `total_cost_usd` from the `result` message, and forwards `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` hooks to `turnLog`. Throws `AskClaudeAbortedError` on signal abort.
- `services/voice/` — Whisper transcription + TTS synthesis (Telegram-side only for now).

**`state/`**

- `state/store.ts` — owns `data/config.json` (consolidated per-user + per-chat state). `load()`, `persist()`, `watch()` (200ms-debounced fs.watch). Schema: `{ users: { "<userId>": UserConfig }, sessions: { "<chatId>": ChatState } }`. Telegram numeric ids and Slack string ids share the same key namespace without colliding. Atomic `tmp + rename` writes.
- `state/sessions.ts` — thin wrapper over `store.ts`. `get(chatId)` / `update(chatId, patch)` accept `number | string`. State carried: `sessionId`, `totalCostUsd`, `allowAlwaysTools[]`, `denyAlwaysTools[]`, plus optional per-chat overrides `workspaceDir` / `permissionMode` / `model`.
- `state/users.ts` — thin wrapper over `store.ts`. All API surface accepts `number | string` user ids (Telegram numerics, Slack `U…`). `ensure(userId)` seeds from `userTemplate.json` on a user's first message. Helpers `effectiveWorkspace`, `effectiveMode`, `effectiveModel` consult chat → user → default; `voiceFor` and `tzFor` are user-only.
- `state/crons.ts` — atomic JSON store at `data/crons.json` keyed by cron id. Each row carries `transport: "telegram" | "slack"` so a cron created from a Slack channel fires back to Slack and vice versa. Legacy untagged rows migrate to `transport: "telegram"` on first load.
- `state/restart-marker.ts` — `data/restart-marker.json` with `chats: RestartChat[]` (each `{ chatId, transport }`). Legacy `chats: number[]` markers migrate to telegram entries.
- `state/turnLog.ts` — append-only `data/turns.jsonl` of pre/post tool events.
- `state/logger.ts` — daily JSON logs at `data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. Categories: `error` / `turn` / `approval` / `cron` / `lifecycle`. `userId` accepts both `number` and `string` so Slack ids serialize cleanly.

**`scheduler/`**

- `scheduler/mcp.ts` — `buildSchedulerMcp(chatId, userId, tz, transport)` returns the per-turn SDK MCP server exposing `cron_create` / `cron_list` / `cron_delete` (closed over the current chat + transport so a Slack cron records `transport: "slack"` and fires back to Slack). `buildSchedulerSystemGuidance(tz, userId, chatId, isGroup)` is the per-turn system-prompt addendum.
- `scheduler/transport.ts` — small `Transport → kickOffTurnFromCron` registry. `index.ts` registers `"telegram"` (from `telegram/app.ts`) and `slack/app.ts` registers `"slack"` itself.
- `scheduler/runner.ts` — `fire(c, lateMs)` builds the prompt and dispatches via the registry.
- `scheduler/ticker.ts` — single `setInterval(60s)` that finds due jobs via `cron-parser` (TZ resolved per row), reserves the slot via `lastFiredAt`, then fires. Catch-up window 30 minutes.

### Per-user / per-chat state model

Two stores, layered for the three "behavior" settings (workspace / permissionMode / model):

- **Per-user app config** (`state/users.ts`, JSON path `data/config.json#users.<userId>`) — workspace, permission mode, model, voice settings, tz, name, notes. The user-level *default*: applies to DMs and to any group that hasn't set its own override. Editable by hand, by Claude (Edit/Write `data/config.json`), or by the slash commands when used from a DM. Auto-reloaded via the `store.watch()` fs.watch.
- **Per-chat runtime state** (`state/sessions.ts`, JSON path `data/config.json#sessions.<chatId>`) — active Claude `sessionId`, cumulative `totalCostUsd`, per-tool `allowAlwaysTools[]` / `denyAlwaysTools[]`, plus optional per-chat overrides for `workspaceDir` / `permissionMode` / `model`. The override layer is what lets the user have a different workspace per Telegram group. The slash commands `/workspace` `/mode` `/model` `/cloudexpert` write to the chat layer in groups (where `chat.type !== "private"`) and to the user layer in DMs.

Both layers live in the **same** file, `data/config.json` — that's the only file you need to copy between machines to reproduce behavior.

Resolvers `users.effectiveWorkspace(chatId, userId, gatewayDir)`, `users.effectiveMode(chatId, userId)`, `users.effectiveModel(chatId, userId)` consult chat → user → default. Always use them instead of reading fields directly. `users.tzFor(userId)` and `users.voiceFor(userId)` stay user-only — those settings don't sensibly differ per-chat.

Note: external edits to `data/config.json` (whether from Claude in a turn or a hand-edit) are picked up by the watcher on the next turn for both layers. The bot still does its own writes, so a Claude edit racing a `sessions.update()` could be clobbered — for chat-layer changes prefer the slash commands; for user-layer defaults, hand-edit / Claude-edit is fine.

`MODEL_ALIASES` maps friendly names (`opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` / `default`) to SDK model IDs. `default` resolves to empty string, meaning "let the SDK pick."

### Turn lifecycle (the part that's easy to break)

1. A transport handler calls `engine.kickOffTurn(io, chatId, userId, prompt, opts?)` (in `core/turnEngine.ts`), which **enqueues** the turn onto a per-chat tail Promise (`turnTailsMap: Map<string, Promise<void>>`) and returns immediately — explicitly **not** awaited. **This is load-bearing for Telegraf.** Telegraf serializes update processing per handler; if a turn awaits inside the handler, the bot stops fetching new updates, including the very `callback_query` clicks (Allow/Deny, AskUserQuestion answers) that would unblock the turn. Deadlock. Slack Bolt has its own concurrency model but the same fire-and-forget pattern keeps everything consistent.
2. Turns for the same chat run **serially**, oldest-first. A new message that arrives mid-turn waits for the current turn (and any already-queued ones) to finish. Different chats run in parallel. Cron fires (via the `Transport → kickOffTurnFromCron` registry in `scheduler/transport.ts`) feed the same queue, so a cron can never preempt an interactive turn. The only paths that abort the in-flight turn are `/new` and `/cancel`, both via the `engine.abortTurn` helper. `/new` aborts + clears `sessionId`; `/cancel` only aborts (session preserved). The queue itself is **not** drained by either command — already-typed messages still run, just in the post-abort session state.
3. `askClaude` runs the SDK `query` loop. Tool calls hit `canUseTool` (in `handlers/toolApprovals.ts`), which:
   - Auto-handles `AskUserQuestion` via `questions.ask` — never prompts for permission.
   - Short-circuits via `allowAlwaysTools` / `denyAlwaysTools`.
   - Otherwise sends a `TurnIO.reply` with the `Allow / Always / Deny / Never` `ButtonGrid` and `await`s an `approvals.register` promise that the transport's `actions.ts` later settles by calling into `handlers/clickRouter.ts → dispatchApprovalClick`.
4. Reply text is split via `chunk()` (3500-char soft cap, prefer newline boundaries) and sent as one or more messages through `TurnIO.reply`.
5. `onSessionId` persists the SDK session id the moment the `system/init` message arrives — so even if the user kills the bot mid-turn, the next message can resume the same Claude session.

### Scheduler (cron jobs)

Claude can schedule recurring prompts via the per-turn `mcp__scheduler__cron_create` / `cron_list` / `cron_delete` tools. State lives in `data/crons.json`; the ticker (`scheduler/ticker.ts`) polls every 60s.

- **`mcp__scheduler__*` tools auto-allow.** `buildCanUseTool` short-circuits any tool whose name starts with `mcp__scheduler__` — no Allow/Deny prompt — because they only mutate `data/crons.json`. The actual prompt that fires later still goes through normal approvals.
- **Cron-fired turns auto-deny non-allow-always tools.** `runTurn` is called with `triggerSource: "cron"`; `buildCanUseTool` rejects anything not in `state.allowAlwaysTools` instead of sending an inline-button approval that nobody is awake to click. To make a cron useful, send the prompt interactively first and tap **Always** on each tool the cron will need (or use `/rules`).
- **Cron-fired turns also auto-deny `AskUserQuestion`** — there's no human reader. The prompt should already contain everything Claude needs.
- **Fresh session per fire by default.** `cron_create` defaults `resume: false`, meaning the fire doesn't carry conversational baggage from the chat's interactive Claude session — and the new sessionId is NOT persisted back into `state.sessionId`, so interactive use stays isolated. Pass `resume: true` for "continue our work every Monday" jobs.
- **One-shot reminders.** Pass `oneShot: true` to `cron_create` for "remind me Sunday at 10" — the ticker deletes the row right after dispatching so a date-specific expression like `0 10 3 5 *` doesn't fire every year. If the slot is missed past the catch-up window, the one-shot is dropped without firing instead of being left as a stale row.
- **Calendar mirroring + config self-edit guidance.** Every turn appends the result of `buildSchedulerSystemGuidance(tz, userId, chatId)` (in `scheduler/mcp.ts`) to the Claude Code preset system prompt. It tells Claude (a) to mirror calendar-event reminders into a Google Calendar MCP if one is loaded for the turn — meetings, appointments, flights, birthdays… — while keeping data-pull crons (weather, news, periodic reports) cron-only; (b) where the user's per-user config lives (`data/config.json` under `users.<userId>`) so Claude can edit it from a DM; and (c) in groups, that workspace/mode/model should be set per-chat via slash commands rather than by editing the user-layer key (which would clobber every other chat). Wiring the calendar MCP itself is out-of-band — `claude mcp add` user-scope so the SDK inherits it; the gateway doesn't bundle calendar credentials.
- **Catch-up window: 30 minutes.** If the bot was down through a slot, the ticker fires it on boot only if the slot was within the last 30 min, and prefixes the prompt with "⏰ ran Nm late — bot was offline." Older slots are recorded as fired (`lastFiredAt`) without dispatching, so they don't accumulate.
- **Idempotency.** `lastFiredAt` is the minute-bucketed timestamp of the slot. The ticker won't refire a slot it has already recorded, even across restarts.
- **TZ is per-user.** Resolved from `users.tzFor(c.userId)` for each cron row at every tick. Default `Asia/Jerusalem`; override per user via the `tz` field on the `users.<id>` block in `data/config.json`. The legacy `TZ=` env var is no longer read.
- **Shutdown order.** `cronTicker.stop()` runs before `gracefulShutdown` so no new fires start during the drain window. In-flight cron turns drain through the same `inFlightChats` mechanism as user turns.

### Graceful reload (tsx watch)

The orchestrator in `index.ts` is wired to SIGINT/SIGTERM. It writes a restart marker (each entry tagged with `transport`), tells in-flight chats "code change detected — bot will reload after this turn finishes" via the matching transport's `notifyChat`, then waits up to 30 minutes for `engine.turnTails()` to drain before stopping the transports. `tsx watch` waits for the old process to exit before spawning the new one, so a Claude turn that edits this bot's own source can finish cleanly.

The transport heuristic in `index.ts` is `Number.isFinite(Number(chatId)) ? "telegram" : "slack"` — Telegram chat ids are integers (positive or negative for groups); Slack ids start with `C/D/G`. They never collide.

For changes to `data/config.json` (per-user defaults *or* per-chat state), there's no restart at all — the `store.watch()` fs.watch fires within ~200ms of the file changing, the new value enters the in-memory cache, and the next turn uses it. Edits made by Claude itself via Edit/Write are picked up the same way.

### Uploads

Photos are sent as base64 image blocks in the SDK `user` message (see `buildPrompt` in `claude.ts`). Non-image documents are written to `<workspace>/.uploads/<timestamp>-<sanitized-name>` and their relative path is included in the prompt — the user's caption (if any) is appended, and Claude is told to use `Read` on the path. 5 MB cap on images.

## Conventions and gotchas

- **`.ts` import extensions are mandatory** — TypeScript's `allowImportingTsExtensions` plus `tsx` runtime, no transpile step.
- **ESM-only** (`"type": "module"`). Use `node:` prefixes for builtins (`node:fs/promises`, `node:path`).
- **Strict mode + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`** — array/object index access yields `T | undefined`. Existing code uses non-null `!` after a presence check (e.g. `q.options[oi]!`); follow the pattern.
- **Layering rule.** `core/` and `handlers/` must not import from `telegram/` or `slack/`. Each transport may import from `core/handlers` but not from the other transport. Shared bits go in `handlers/commandShared.ts` / `handlers/respondModes.ts`.
- **Telegraf handlers must return fast.** Handlers that need to do long work must `void`-dispatch a separate async function (see `engine.kickOffTurn`). The `handlerTimeout` default is 90 s.
- **Markdown replies have a fallback.** Telegram rejects malformed Markdown with HTTP 400. Wrap `ctx.reply(text, { parse_mode: "Markdown" })` in try/catch and resend with `text.replace(/[*_`]/g, "")` — see existing examples.
- **`safeAnswerCbQuery`** swallows the "query is too old" / "query ID is invalid" errors that Telegram returns when the bot answers a callback after a restart. Use it instead of `ctx.answerCbQuery` directly.
- **The Claude session id is the resume key.** `state.sessionId` is what gets passed as `resume` on the next turn. Don't clear it on errors — only on `/new` or explicit `/resume reset`.
- **Auth is a hard wall.** The `bot.use` middleware drops every update whose `ctx.from.id` isn't in `config.allowedUserIds` (parsed from env). After auth passes, the middleware also calls `users.ensure(userId)` so a freshly-allowed user gets a default `users.<id>` block seeded from `userTemplate.json` inside `data/config.json` on their first message. New handlers don't need to re-check auth.
- **Layered behavior config.** Workspace / permissionMode / model resolve chat → user → default. Slash commands `/workspace` `/mode` `/model` `/cloudexpert` write to the chat layer in groups, the user layer in DMs (so each Telegram group gets its own persistent workspace without changing the user's other chats). `/rules` writes to ChatState because tool-trust is per-conversation. Voice and tz remain user-only.
- **`data/` and `workspace/` are git-ignored.** The session store, turn log, restart marker, per-user app configs, and Claude's default working directory all live under those paths; never commit them.
- **`/cloudexpert` is a personal shortcut** that hard-codes `D:\cloudexpert` as the workspace. Keep it (or generalize) — don't be surprised by a Windows path in source.
- **The bot never edits `.env`.** Personal/auth info (bot token, allowlist, oauth) stays in env. App behavior lives in `data/config.json` (under `users.<id>` for per-user defaults, `sessions.<chatId>` for per-chat state) — that's the file Claude is told to edit when the user asks for a config change.
